## Test Steps

### Test 1: Meeting Creation and Validation
1. Start backend: `cd Backend && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `cd videocall && npm run dev`
3. **Test Create Meeting**:
   - Click "Create New Meeting" button
   - Should generate a 6-character meeting ID
   - Should navigate to the meeting room
4. **Test Join Non-existent Meeting**:
   - Try to join a random 6-character ID (e.g., "XYZ789")
   - Should show error: "Meeting not found or has ended. Please ask the host to create a new meeting."
5. **Test Invalid Meeting ID**:
   - Try to join "ABC" (too short)
   - Try to join "ABCDEFG" (too long)
   - Try to join "ABC@12" (special characters)
   - Should show validation error

### Test 2: Audio Functionality
1. Create a meeting from one device
2. Join the same meeting from another device
3. **Test Audio Permissions**:
   - Both devices should request microphone permission
   - Allow permissions when prompted
4. **Test Audio Transmission**:
   - Speak on one device
   - Verify audio is heard on the other device
   - Check audio level indicator (green button + blinking dot)
5. **Test Audio Toggle**:
   - Click microphone button to mute/unmute
   - Should work immediately
   - Audio level should drop to 0 when muted

### Test 3: Video Functionality
1. Join a meeting from two devices
2. **Test Video Display**:
   - Both devices should show their own video
   - Both devices should show the other participant's video
   - Videos should be properly sized and positioned
3. **Test Video Toggle**:
   - Click video button to turn off/on camera
   - Should work immediately
   - Other participant should see video turn off/on
4. **Test Video Quality**:
   - Video should be clear and smooth
   - No significant lag or freezing

## Troubleshooting

### If Meeting Validation Still Doesn't Work
1. Check if backend is running updated code
2. Restart backend server
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check browser console for errors

### If Audio Still Doesn't Work
1. Check browser permissions (Chrome settings)
2. Try different browser (Chrome works best)
3. Check if microphone is not being used by other apps
4. Verify device microphone is working

### If Video Still Doesn't Show
1. Check browser permissions
2. Ensure camera access is allowed
3. Check if camera is used by other apps
4. Try different browser if issues persist

### If Network Errors Persist
1. Verify both devices on same WiFi
2. Check firewall settings
3. Try setup script again
4. Check if ports 5000 and 5173 are accessible
