## Test Cases

### Meeting Validation Test
1. Start the backend: `cd Backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd videocall && npm run dev`
3. Create a meeting (e.g., ABC123)
4. Join the meeting from one device
5. End the meeting
6. Try to join the same meeting ID from another device
7. **Expected**: Should not be able to join or should get an error

### Audio Test
1. Join a meeting from your phone
2. Check if audio permissions are requested
3. Test microphone toggle button
4. Test with another device to verify audio transmission
5. **Expected**: Audio should work properly on mobile

### Permission Error Test
1. Block camera/microphone permissions in browser
2. Try to join a meeting
3. **Expected**: Should show a clear error message about permissions

### Meeting ID Format Test
1. Try to enter invalid meeting IDs (too short, too long, special characters)
2. **Expected**: Should show validation error

## Mobile-Specific Tests

### Network Test
1. Run the setup script: `npm run setup-mobile`
2. Access from phone using the provided URL
3. **Expected**: Should connect without network errors

### Audio on Mobile
1. Join meeting from phone
2. Allow microphone permissions
3. Speak and verify audio is transmitted
4. **Expected**: Audio should work on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### If Audio Still Doesn't Work

2. Try different browsers (Chrome works best)
3. Check if microphone is not being used by other apps
4. Verify device microphone is working

### If Old Meetings Can Still Be Joined
1. Check if backend is running the updated code
2. Restart the backend server
3. Clear browser cache

### If Network Errors Persist
1. Verify both devices are on same WiFi
2. Check firewall settings
3. Try using the setup script again
